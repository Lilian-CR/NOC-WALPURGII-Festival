# NOC-WALPURGII-Festival
The Noc Walpurgii festival returns to Warsaw to celebrate its 30th anniversary! This year's edition will take place on April 30, 2026, at the VooDoo club.

The first edition of the festival took place on April 30, 1996, during the legendary Witches' Festival, at Warsaw's Stodoła club.

It was a groundbreaking event in the local independent scene, with the guiding principle of emphasizing the participation of women and non-heteronormative people in independent culture. Walpurgis Night also expressed open opposition to sexism, homophobia, and all forms of exclusion.
Walpurgis Night – the legendary holiday and time of witches' gold – became the inspiration for the festival, which has always been intended to empower, inspire, expand awareness, and create a space for all excluded people to celebrate our diversity together.

From the beginning, Walpurgis Night was more than just a series of concerts – it encompassed performances, happenings, meetings, workshops, DJ sets, and many other creative forms of artistic expression, sometimes including demonstrations like "Reclaim the Night" and film screenings.

From 1996 to 2010, the festival took place in Warsaw, and then moved to Berlin, where it continued until 2018 (with a break due to the pandemic in 2020). Now, after 16 years, the event returns to Warsaw to celebrate three decades of its existence in a unique way!

We invite everyone interested in the festival's character – both those who participated in previous editions and those who have not yet had the opportunity to experience Walpurgis Night!
